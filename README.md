# shoppingCart

Step 1:

1) Create a bean with name & price corresponding to apple & orange.
2) Create a ShoppingCart class which will store the apple & oranges in a ArrayList.
3) ShoppingCart class will contain a method to add item and a method to checkout items.
4) We will have a main class which will instantiate the ShoppingCart class, add the items to the Array list in ShoppingCart and call the checkout method after all the items are added.
